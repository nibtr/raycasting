# raycasting

A simple raycasting rendering in Wolfenstein-style using vanilla JS canvas APIs. The project is a proof of concept for future similar ideas (e.g. games, although unsure), and is built for educational purposes.

*Note*: Since it is simply rendered on HTML canvas, poor performance on old machines and browsers are expected.

## Control

W: forward; S: backward; A,D: rotate

## References

The renderer is heavily inspired by [https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html) with some minor adjustments for simplicity.
